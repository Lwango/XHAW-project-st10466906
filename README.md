 Consistency with Mobile App
The website is designed to align with the **Alfredo mobile application**:
- Both use **simple and accessible layouts**  
- Navigation is **clear and intuitive**  
- Branding and design choices are **consistent** across web and mobile  



##  Design Rationale
The reasons I have chosen these designs for my website is because of its simple yet interactive design and its easy-to-navigate layout. It is easily accessible for all users.  

Users require:
- Easy-to-navigate icons  
- A clear and informative homepage  
- Summaries of the six-month and six-week courses  
- Contact details at the bottom of the page  

The mobile app was chosen because it provides an **on-the-go solution** for students, ensuring access to course details and fees anytime, anywhere.
